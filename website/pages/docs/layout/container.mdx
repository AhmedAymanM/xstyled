# Container

A component for fixing an element's width to the current breakpoint.

| React props         | Breakpoints  | CSS Properties       |
| ------------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| `container=[value]` | None         | `width: 100%;`       |
|                     | sm (640px)   | `max-width: 640px;`  |
|                     | md (768px)   | `max-width: 768px;`  |
|                     | lg (1024px)  | `max-width: 1024px;` |
|                     | xl (1280px)  | `max-width: 1280px;` |
|                     | 2xl (1536px) | `max-width: 1536px;` |

## Usage

The `container` utility sets the `max-width` of an element to match the `min-width` of the current breakpoint. This is useful if you'd prefer to design for a fixed set of screen sizes instead of trying to accommodate a fully fluid viewport.

Note that unlike containers you might have used in other frameworks, **xstyled's container does not center itself automatically and does not have any built-in horizontal padding**.

To center a container, use the `mx="auto"` utility:

```jsx
<Box container mx="auto">
  {/* ... */}
</Box>
```

To add horizontal padding, use the `px={size}` utility:

```jsx
<Box container mx="auto" px={4}>
  {/* ... */}
</Box>
```

## Responsive

Use `container={breakpoints}` to make something behave like a container at only a certain breakpoint and up:

```jsx
<Box container={{ md: true }}>
  {/* Full-width fluid until the `lg` breakpoint, then lock to container */}
  {/* ... */}
</Box>
```

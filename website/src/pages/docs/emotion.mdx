# Use with emotion

There is no alternative of `@xstyled/styled-components` for [emotion](https://emotion.sh). But `@xstyled/system` is fully compatible!

## System as props

You can create your own system components with emotion:

```js
import styled from 'emotion-styled'
import { system } from '@xstyled/system'

const Box = styled.div(system)
```

## System as getters

System as getters are also available for emotion styled components.

```js
import styled from 'emotion-styled'
import { th } from '@xstyled/system'

const Box = styled.div`
  background-color: ${th.color('primary')};
`
```

## System as styled

System as styled is coming for emotion, today you are stick with system as getters, sorry!

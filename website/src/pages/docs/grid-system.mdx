# Grid system

Grid system is a powerful mobile-first flexbox grid. You can build all kind of shapes, layouts. It is like [bootstrap grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/) on steroid.

## How it works

xstyled's grid system uses two properties `row` and `col`, and of course all system properties. It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth look at how the grid comes together.

**New to or unfamiliar with flexbox?** [Read this CSS Tricks flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-background) for background, terminology, guidelines, and code snippets.

```jsx live noInline
import styled, { Box } from '@xstyled/styled-components'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Box row mx={-8}>
      <Box col px={8}>
        Column 1
      </Box>
      <Box col px={8}>
        Column 2
      </Box>
      <Box col px={8}>
        Column 3
      </Box>
    </Box>
  )
}

render(<Example />)
```

The above example creates three equal-width columns on small, medium, large, and extra large devices using our predefined grid classes.

Breaking it down, here’s how it works:

- Rows are wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding (`px`) for controlling the space between them. This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins (`mx`). This way, all the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side.
- In a grid layout, content must be placed within columns and only columns may be immediate children of rows.
- Thanks to flexbox, grid columns without a specified `width` will automatically layout as equal width columns. For example, four instances of `col` will each automatically be 25% wide from the small breakpoint and up. See the auto-layout columns section for more examples.
- Column classes indicate the percentage by the `col` on the current `row`. So, if you want three equal-width columns across, you can use `col={1/4}`. Using fraction is often easier to understand.
- Column `width`s are set in percentages, so they’re always fluid and sized relative to their parent element.
- Columns don't have padding by default, but you can add it with `px` on `col` and negative `mx` on `row`.
- To make the grid responsive, there are five grid breakpoints, one for each [responsive breakpoint](/docs/responsive/): all breakpoints (extra small), small, medium, large, and extra large.
- Grid breakpoints are based on minimum width media queries, meaning **they apply to that one breakpoint and all those above it** (e.g., `col={{ sm: 1/4 }}` applies to small, medium, large, and extra large devices, but not the first xs breakpoint).

Be aware of the limitations and [bugs around flexbox](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs), like [the inability to use some HTML elements as flex containers](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs#flexbug-9).

## Set your columns width

- A `col`'s value is comprised between 0 and 1 (`true` means `flex: 1`).
- It is better to use fractions like 1/2 or 1/4 to quickly see the number of elements displayed on a `row`.
- If a `col` value isn't specified, the latter will adjust its size depending on the situation:
  - If the sum of all columns on the same line isn't equal to 1: it will fill up the available space on the line.
  - If the sum of all columns on the same line is equal to 1: it will fill up an entire line below.
- Each `col` is fully responsive and will adjust its size according to the viewport.

In the following example, the middle column will take `50%` of the available space.

```jsx live noInline
import styled, { Box } from '@xstyled/styled-components'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Box row>
      <Box col>Column 1</Box>
      <Box col={1 / 2}>Column 2</Box>
      <Box col>Column 3</Box>
    </Box>
  )
}

render(<Example />)
```

## Auto-layout columns

### Equal-width

For example, here are two grid layouts that apply to every device and viewport, from `xs` to `xl`. Add any number of unit-less props for each breakpoint you need and every column will be the same width.

```js live noInline
import styled, { Box } from '@xstyled/styled-components'

function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Box row>
        <Box col>1 of 2</Box>
        <Box col>2 of 2</Box>
      </Box>
      <Box row>
        <Box col>1 of 3</Box>
        <Box col>2 of 3</Box>
        <Box col>3 of 3</Box>
      </Box>
    </>
  )
}

render(<Example />)
```

### Equal-width multi row

Create equal-width columns that span multiple rows by inserting a `<Box width={1} />` where you want the columns to break to a new line.

```js live noInline
import styled, { Box } from '@xstyled/styled-components'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Box row>
      <Box col>Column</Box>
      <Box col>Column</Box>
      <Box width={1} />
      <Box col>Column</Box>
      <Box col>Column</Box>
    </Box>
  )
}

render(<Example />)
```

### Setting one column width

Auto-layout for flexbox grid columns also means you can set the width of one column and have the sibling columns automatically resize around it.

```js live noInline
import styled, { Box } from '@xstyled/styled-components'

function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Box row>
        <Box col>1 of 3</Box>
        <Box col={1 / 2}>2 of 3 (wider)</Box>
        <Box col>3 of 3</Box>
      </Box>
      <Box row>
        <Box col>1 of 3</Box>
        <Box col={2 / 3}>2 of 3 (wider)</Box>
        <Box col>3 of 3</Box>
      </Box>
    </>
  )
}

render(<Example />)
```

### Variable width content

Use "auto" to size columns based on the natural width of their content.

```js live noInline
import styled, { Box } from '@xstyled/styled-components'

function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <Box row justifyContent={{ md: 'center' }}>
        <Box col={{ lg: 1 / 6 }}>1 of 3</Box>
        <Box col="auto">Variable width content</Box>
        <Box col={{ lg: 1 / 6 }}>3 of 3</Box>
      </Box>
      <Box row>
        <Box col>1 of 3</Box>
        <Box col="auto">Variable width content</Box>
        <Box col>3 of 3</Box>
      </Box>
    </>
  )
}

render(<Example />)
```

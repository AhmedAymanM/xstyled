# Motivation

Two years ago, I discovered [styled-components](https://styled-components.com), it was a game changer for all my projects. At Smooth Code, we adopted it has significantly reduced the time of development. A year later, I discovered [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system), again it was a game-changer, being able to use prop directly based on theme is amazing.

styled-system is great, so great that I wanted to add it in the core of [Smooth UI](https://smooth-ui.smooth-code.com). Unfortunately it wasn't enough performant to be added in the core of the library. So I decided to rewrite it, I optimized it, added a bunch of features, fixed things.

I [contributed to styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system/pull/479), I refactored all the code, introduce tree shaking, features... But unfortunately my vision and Brent Jackson vision were not as closed as I expected. That's why I decided to create xstyled. xstyled follows the styled-system specification but it moves faster, I have more freedom.

After one year using a system in your code, we push it to the next step, being able to use the system right in CSS props. Again it is a game changer and a signficant gain of time!

# Motivation

Two years ago, I discovered [styled-components](https://styled-components.com), it was a game changer for all my projects. At Smooth Code, we adopted it has significantly reduced the time of development. A year later, I discovered [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system), it was great discovery! Being able to style your components directly from props in a consistent way is so powerful.

styled-system is great, so great that I wanted to add it in the core of [Smooth UI](https://smooth-ui.smooth-code.com). Unfortunately it wasn't enough performant to be added in the core of the library. That's why I decided to rewrite it, I optimized it, added a bunch of features, fixed things.

For the records, [I contributed to styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system/pull/479). I refactored the codebase, introduce tree shaking and severals features... Unfortunately Brent Jackson vision was not as closed as mine than expected. That's why I decided to create xstyled. It follows styled-system specification but it evolves faster and gives me more freedom!

After one year using system based props in our code, we push it to the next step : being able to use the system right in CSS props. It provides significant time-savings!
